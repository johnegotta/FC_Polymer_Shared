Archaeologists: people who study the artifacts, relics, and tools of past civilizations to learn about the activity of humans in the past. Archaeology is considered both a science and a humanity as archaeologists must have wide knowledge of history, ethnology, chemistry, physics, geology, geography, and linguistics in order to find appropriate spots to excavate and then analyze the findings correctly. Question 109 implies that Professor Hicks is correcting misconceptions forwarded by the Indiana Jones films, which show archaeology professor Henry Jones, who adopted the name Indiana in honor of his childhood dog, venturing off on dangerous solo missions to recover, among other things, the Ark of the Covenant—the legendary container of the stone tablets upon which God purportedly etched the Ten Commandments—which the Nazis have attempted to steal and use for nefarious (evil, malicious) purposes. 
Archimedes, a famous Greek inventor and mathematician, at the moment he exclaimed “Eureka!” after realizing that the mass and composition of a metal alloy could be determined through the displacement of water. As the legend goes a king suspected an unscrupulous metallurgist of substituting silver or some other cheaper metal for gold in a new crown the king had received.  Archimedes was to determine if the crown were in fact debased (possessed metals of substandard quality or value).  To do so, he used a method that required the use of a balance which had on one side a mass of pure gold equal to the mass of the crown.  When the perfectly balanced balance was then placed in water, the denser metal (the one with more gold) would sink.  If the crown and the pure gold were both of equal density, both pure gold, then changing the medium in which the balance was placed would not upset the balances balance.  According to the story, Archimedes was able to prove that the goldsmith was a charlatan by using the above described water displacement method.  This method “displaced” the goldsmith’s head from his body… The king had the unscrupulous goldsmith beheaded.  On the Picture Below: Archimedes is said to have come up with his approach to determining the density of the metal in the crown while bathing.  Archimedes was in the tub, witnessed how his body, and objects of different densities displaced different volumes of water, and was so inspired, he cried, “Eureka!” which meant “I found or discovered it!” in ancient Greek.  Repeatedly yelling, “Eureka!” legend has it that Archimedes then ran through the streets, directly to the king to test his idea.  Archimedes neglected to dress before running straight to the king.

So, if a compliment was backhanded, it would mean that the remark seemed to be good (right or right handed), but was actually an insult (such as the right hand coming from the left side, as in a backhanded slap). 
Balanced: (See 1336, in text) mixed, varied, sensible, stable, pragmatic. Or, emotionally stable, even tempered or adequately distributed.

In the below, list all of your poor work habits or “attitudes”—(“attitude” here is a euphemism, and that is why I used “QUOTES” around the word: quotes around a word indicate that the author may be using the word euphemistically, metaphorically, in a different sense, as a new term, slightly incorrectly—or, correctly or incorrectly but as a quote which someone else said)—and then write: 
Bedraggle: disheveled, disordered, untidy, unkempt, tousled
Belied: Describe and act or set of actions you have performed which “belied” your true feelings or intent; then use belied in a sentence related to that act or action you took: .

Berkeley: Berkley is a large public university in California across the bay from Stanford.  The school is renowned for its work in fusion, nuclear weapons manufacture, lasers, physics, linguistics and computer science.  It also has top ranked professional schools in law and medicine.  The campus is large and sprawling, urban, but often feels cramped to the 36,000 students who call Berkeley home.  (While the land owned is more than 6,500 acres, less than 180 acres are used for the main campus.) Below are the westward view of Berkeley campus, out towards the Bay and the eastward view into the Oakland Hills.

A shame… for certain.
Billboards: advertisements, large signs on the side of the road.  Metaphorically, to advertise your intent or hang it on a billboard. 
Biotic: relating to life, organisms, organic material that is part or can be integrated into a living organism; living things can be described as biotic.  This word is difficult to use in context. EXAMPLE: The preservation of biotic diversity is one of the primary goals of many ecological movements.  
Blind (825): Use blind as the basis of an extended metaphor, meaning: write a pair of sentences here which use blinding, light, darkness, and metaphoric lack of vision as the basis of an extended metaphor, a metaphor that extends beyond the single use and the sentence in which it is first used.  In this case, a blind extended metaphor would include someone who is lost, cannot see, blinded by greed, blinded by want, blinded to the dangers of someone he trusts, because his trust blinds him etc.  Such blindness usually leaves a person unguided, misguided, wandering, lost, grasping, fumbling, groping in the dark, or completely without vision, clear sight, normal prudence, and usually economic sense.  Certainly, the person blinded would never be “visionary.”  Write five sentences using the blind extended metaphor suggested in this paragraph:
Blinded: sightless, metaphorically, sightless, lacking vision, groping, myopic, narrow-minded, distracted, dogmatic, partisan

Bodies: objects in space, in this context. 
Body of knowledge: a complete set of concepts, ideas or information related to a specific area of study.  The body of knowledge in a particular area or discipline is all that the “smart guys and girls” in a subject area happen to know.  For example, the “body of knowledge” in mathematics, generally, is ALL MATH, everyone knows, in all imaginable mathematical disciplines on Earth: this is a HUGE body of knowledge, and a very complicated one.  In contrast, the “body of knowledge” in mathematics related to the positive integers less than 2, would be a small body of knowledge, related to all the different mathematical concepts associated with the integer 1: the only positive integer less than 2.  Of import (importantly), information and knowledge related to the number 1, not represented as an integer (when represented as any of an innumerable variety of fractions or other expressions) would not likely be included in the “positive integers less than two” body of knowledge.  The point here is that a body of knowledge includes everything that is defined as part of the set of knowledge in that body, but the definition of “that body” is relatively strict.  This definition in total may be too detailed, but it is kind of a fun exercise in distinguishing/discriminating/parsing language, sets, math and words: languages.  And, parsing language or making fine distinctions is the larger point of this exercise.  (I do hope that discussion was pointed enough for you all!!! ☺ .)

They are blowhards, windbags, and braggarts who use fancy language to seem important.)

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: a British politician who acted as Prime Minster from 1940 to 1945, during World War II, and again from 1951 to 1955. His refusal of an armistice, or treaty, with Germany, kept the British resistance alive, with England serving as a base for later counterattacks to stop German expansion during the war. Churchill was not only a strong wartime leader, but he was quite a polymath, both becoming an accomplished and prominent painter and a Nobel-prize winning author who was lauded for his biographies, memoirs, and histories, including the six-volume memoir, The Second World War, and the four-volume history, A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, which covers the period from Caesar’s invasion of Britain in 55 BC to the First World War, which started in 1914.

Through 2013, Myanmar has become increasingly integrated into the Southeast Asian and World Economic Communities.

Byzantine (historical note): You define it.  ,The Byzantine empire, when it returned to Muslim, Turkish control in around 1300, no longer could represent human figures in art.  As a result, artistic expression took on a geometric quality, meaning the patters in the art work and tapestry became intricate and complicated interwoven patterns.  These complex patters became known as Byzantine works of art.  As a result, any complex or intricate pattern can be called “byzantine.” 
Byzantine: (261, 316, 1071, See 313, in text): Draw a byzantine design in the box below:

Recall, simply because you have gained knowledge does not mean that you have gained true experience of the world.  Reading about the world is one thing, living in it and experiencing the struggles related to its often turbulent conflicts is a different learning experience than any school could possibly offer. 
Callow:  naïve, innocent, inexperienced, young, immature, raw, uncultured.  EXAMPLE: A choice that some hope will be made in the coming education debate is that large swaths of the United States population will remain uncultured, callow, ignorant, and less “revolutionary.”  We at Focused just hope you all have the opportunity to gain experience and knowledge of the world at a younger age, so that you will not feel callow, long after you youth has passed.

Churchill was well known for his uplifting and inspiring speeches that steeled the resolve of the embattled British; he even won over the members of Parliament who had initially opposed his appointment as Prime Minister before England entered World War II, eventually having his former detractors hanging on his every word and even cheering. Not only capable of being moving and encouraging, Churchill was also known to have a silver tongue (ability to make pithy retorts and engage in witty repartee), often uttering sarcastic, biting, and rather offensive remarks. For example, he joked, “The best argument against Democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.” When caught falling asleep at an assembly, he was asked, “Mr. Churchill, must you fall asleep when I’m speaking?” He responded, “No, it’s purely voluntary.” And after he angered a member of the House of Commons, Lady Astor, she told him, “If I was your wife, sir, I would poison your coffee.” Churchill quickly retorted, “If I was your husband, I would drink it.”
Cinematic: photographic, movielike, filmic: having a scope, topic, grandeur, tragic quality, or subject matter which would be well suited to film.  EXAMPLE: Few lives have facts and events that could truly be called cinematic; however, the life of Sig Zane, particularly when the drama related to his father’s murder and the related intrigue are considered seems not only cinematic but almost mythic in structure and scope. 
Cinnamon: Cinnamon is a spice used in both savory and sweet dishes that is harvested from the inner bark of several types of trees. In the past, cinnamon was a highly prized commodity, and was even considered a gift to be given to monarchs or even offered to gods. Curiously, there is also an urban legend that says that people who are about to suffer a stroke (when a blood clot interrupts the flow of blood to the brain) smell cinnamon or French toast shortly before they feel the effects of the blockage, which may include inability to speak, loss of memory, loss of consciousness, and paralysis. While this is most likely untrue, a stroke could possibly affect the areas of the brain responsible for recognition of smells, but it would be more likely to completely disable the sense of smell rather than cause you to smell something that is not there. Regardless, if your instructor tells you that you look like you’re smelling cinnamon, you should perk up and try to be more alert in class.

WARNING!: Do not cross off climate simply because the sentence does not discuss weather.  Metaphoric meanings can be used and are usually a little bit more sophisticated.

Collegiate and graduate studies: The stuff all you guys will have to go through after high school.  It’s okay fun, but you don’t learn as much as you likely should there, and its way to abstract and ego driven. I found most of it esoteric, often irrelevant, pedantic, and more often than I would have liked, obscure to the point that I wondered who on earth would ever use any of this information.  I don’t feel that way about these words, or the math, grammar and other neat stuff you are all learning with us. They seem so foundational, essential, even basal, as to not only be necessary to but also naturally fostering of the type of intelligence I believe indispensable to bring about a better world And, that is what makes the work so meaningful and fun.  You should all try to find meaningful and fun work someday. (I was didactic right there, if you missed it.)  
Comely: handsome, attractive, agreeable, suitable, compliant, courteous, pleasant. Comeliness is a beauty and delicacy, particularly of one’s facial features.  Comeliness often suggests a facial beauty that  is somewhat feminine in nature. EXAMPLE: One would be hard pressed (one would find it difficult) to earnestly (honestly) suggest that any of the Enlightenment Thinkers pictured above possessed a countenance (face) anywhere close to comely.  Napoleon II, a late Enlightenment/early Romantic Period personage (person), however, was viewed by many to have been quite comely. Similarly, Bonnie Prince Charles Edward Stewart, “The Pretender” mentioned in satire A Modest Proposal, above, was also said to be a rather “comely” lad (young man, boy). Of note, bonnie means handsome or pretty in an almost feminine way. “Bonnie”, however, is an informal or slang term, used primarily in Scotland.  Below, both Napoleon II and Bonnie Prince Charlie—The Pretender.  Bonnie Prince Charles is riding the horse, wearing a Scottish tartan (plaid wool Scottish plaid.)

Destabilize: (741, 827, 846, see, 271, in text) Ships that have their cargo loaded asymmetrically will often destabilize. Essentially, the center of gravity of the boat is shifted to one side of the boat, which means that it is no longer aligned with the center of buoyancy, the point through which the upward force from the water that keeps the boat afloat is focused (the center of the portion of the hull, or frame, that is submerged). The two forces, gravity pulling down and buoyancy pushing up, induce a moment, or twisting force, which causes the boat to heel, or roll onto its side, taking on an angle of list and settling when the center of gravity once again aligns with the center of buoyancy and the two act along the same vertical line, removing the moment, or torque, that caused the ship to roll. In the drawings below, G is the center of gravity and B is the center of buoyancy. In the second picture, after the ship has rolled, you see that the center of buoyancy, B, has shifted from its original position, B’, and is now aligned vertically with G (which has not moved), because the center of the submerged portion of the hull has shifted to the side of the boat that is now more underwater.

Discipline: (Area of knowledge): (620, 726, See 184, 353, 614, 728, in text): Most of our purpose at Focused Coaching is to offer students entrée into a discipline appropriate to their true desires, and to teach each and every student a disciplined way of thinking.  We use analogies and metaphors to convey the discipline we hope to impart upon and lead students towards, but we are rarely direct with students, asking “them” what particular “disciplines” in which each may personally find the greatest satisfaction, regardless of “aptitude”.  In light of the above oversight, and in an effort to be equitable or at least not remiss, we now ask each and every one of you the following:

Another gem of the East Coast is Boston, north of New York, which boasts the academic and scientific powerhouses MIT and Harvard. All of the Ivy League Schools and oldest schools in the nation are on the East Coast, and in the North East in specific.  For clarification, often when one states that he or she is from the East Coast, the North Eastern Coast is what is meant, as people from that region tend to believe that the southeastern Atlantic seaboard is really more than culturally, intellectually, financially, educationally, scientifically, and artistically more aligned and connected to the United States South. The opinions of those from the South Eastern Seaboard about this Northeastern generalization vary.   (This statement is a tongue-in-cheek, or dryly humorous way of making fun of people from the north east for thinking that they are the center of the world and everyone else doesn’t belong or isn’t as good. Remember, dry humor, it’s just weird, not really funny.  I think the above perfectly fits that description.)

Economic (2) financial, monetary, pecuniary, fiscal  It is of note that the SAT often favors using the less popular 3rd or 4th definition of common or “easy” words such as economic, base, smart, familiar etc. They often appear not only as sentence completion/vocab questions but also as “context” questions in the passage based reading (i.e. In context the word “base” in line 29 most nearly means?)

Fracking involves injecting millions of gallons of highly pressurized fracking fluids, which contain highly toxic chemicals like lead and benzene, into the layers of shale deep below the surface in order to form new conduits, or channels, by which gas and oil can be extracted more quickly. There are claims that the toxic waste can be cleaned, but ultimately, it is unlikely that we will ever recover all of the sludge that has been allowed to seep into the soil and contaminate the drinking water for many of the states where fracking is common, such as Virginia, Texas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

Equivocate: (17, 18, 99, 344) Politicians are known for giving equivocal answers to direct questions in order to avoid committing themselves to a definite stance, often to avoid looking fickle or flighty when they fail to carry through on an act that is expected of them based on their purported interests or promises, or to purposely cover up secrets or beliefs that would be unpopular or possible even defamatory. For example, Anthony Weiner was equivocal when asked about his alter ego, Carlos Danger, who was known to exchange illicit pictures on twitter, saying that the account was a joke, and downplaying the scandal that rocked his marriage and compromised his political career.

Exercise this right to educate yourself by immersing yourself wholly in some field of expertise, but always remember that truly intelligent people examine diverse fields in order to make connections and draw parallels (find similarities) that may help them better understand dilemmas in their own disciplines.

Excess: (253, See 42, 71, 202, 235, 248, in text): List three (3) synonyms and (2) antonyms for the word “excess” :
Excessive: like hedonistic, profusion, or extravagance, excessive or an excess, means an extreme amount, more than is reasonable, or which can be accounted for by prudence, providence, or thrift. 
Excise: remove, expunge, eliminate, take-out, eradicate: an excise tax is a tax in a domestic market; for example, gasoline, cigarettes and wine all have excise taxes on them in the United States, extra taxes that are simply added to the price of the product.  You do not see an excise tax, you simply pay it back to the retailer of the product.  The retailer then pays that use tax to the government.  The reason the word excise is used to describe an excise tax and to remove or cut out is a little clouded.  Some have speculated that excise taxes are called “excise” taxed because they are only placed on products that a government should want to remove or expunge: either (1) foreign products that are subject to tariffs, products that don’t help domestic business per se because they are made in other nations and therefore should “expunged or excised” from domestic markets, or (2) products that are damaging to health, morality, or the environment (gas, cigarettes, liquor, etc.) which the government should likewise seek to excise or expunge from society.  This speculation finds little documentary support based on word usage in the 15th and 16th century, when the excise came into use in the two senses mentioned above. The other possible origins of the word’s two seemingly divergent meanings, however, do not seem terribly convincing. 
Exclamation: cry, call, yell, shout, scream, outcry.

Scott Fitzgerald, and Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast gives an illuminating look into the lives of many of the eccentric artists who were drawn to the hotbed of intellectualism and innovation.

EXAMPLE: The political leader informed his deputies to clear away all of the bureaucratic red tape and do anything else necessary to expedite the approval of the licenses for new technology desperately needed to better the economy.

What the student said was that Drake used a large pair of 100 foot long scissors or sheers, conducted a health related, or religious act of genital mutilation on the entire world. This is a funny image.  Try your best to think of three funny diction errors that would be considered malapropisms.

Famous Satirists: Mark Twain; Nikolai Gogol; Shakespeare, really any and all great artists at some point foray into satire.  The most shocking of these forays, however, and something we at Focused believe all should read is the following bit from Johnathan Swift’s: A Modest Proposal: The subject of the satire is the exploitive taxation of the Irish and their children (to the point of starvation) by the British aristocracy. The text in its original entirety is included below, but may be skipped if you do not happen to be interested in the satire.  Vocabulary continues on page 143. You may skip this portion, but if you were to read it, it would be best to attend the footnotes quite carefully.

Fondness
Foolproof
Foregoing: previous, last mentioned; or, bypass, ignore, circumvent, step over, skip: EXAMPLE: The computer science department at Berkeley allowed John to forego the usual math requirements for a degree in computer science as John had already fulfilled the program’s core requirements 2 dozen times over, during his engineering and mathematics college and graduate education.

Fortify: (528): Use “fortify” in an extended metaphor relating to fortifying someone (“steeling his resolve”) to work harder and suffer through any trial or tedious work in order to achieve something great.  Remember, overcoming obstacles, rising from a fall, and suffering but surviving when no one else could often are the key ingredients to a successful life, possessed of an overwhelming almost unbelievable life story. This fantastic story of a life, however, is usually only possible because the person living that life  actually was fortified by the recollection of his own bravery and strength of character in overcoming obstacles.  These early acts, and the bravery and strength of character they engendered, formed the moat, castle walls, and watch towers of his later success. For, all of life’s  amazing success stories are built one small obstacle overcoming brick at a time, and these bricks are then held together by the mortar that is the courage to overcome adversity.  Try writing five 5 sentences and use fortification or related metaphors in each of the sentences. Keep the metaphors related or the you may make a style and logic error called “mixing a metaphor”.  (I will explain later.):
Fortify: (528, 842) Here are three examples of items which exemplify fortification, fortifying, and even edification.  The first image is of a new born Jules, who fortified my resolve to build these materials and work as hard as I can to ensure that he will have the best education and the most opportunity I might help provide.  Please explain how the other two pictures (aside from Jules) are fortifications, and then describe something that has personally fortified or edified you:

Frigate: In general, this is a term for any warship, since it has been used for ships of various sizes and purposes over the years. Initially, in the 17th century, the term described warships that were built for speed and maneuverability and that had all of their large weapons situated, or located, on only one deck, or level, of the ship. At this time, frigates were generally too small to be considered “ships of the line”—these larger ships were used in a common form of naval warfare, which was basically always won by the side with bigger heavier ships and cannons, consisted of running a whole convoy of ships, sailing end to end in a line, past the location of enemy ships, which were often similarly queued in such a fashion, in order to fire a constant barrage from the mounted guns, which shot out from the side of the ships.
Frigid
Frisky 
Frugal: (See 27, 694, in text) thrifty, pennywise, abstemious, provident, economical: EXAMPLE: Being frugal and prudent with your money is one thing; being cheap to the point of hording your wealth and refusing to part with even a single penny is quite another.

In the words of Noah Webster in 1828: showy beyond the simplicity of nature or good taste.  See picture below for ostentatious.  Ostentatious is showy, and flashy, but not necessarily gaudy.  The picture of the car with rubies and gold as an interior, well, it is gaudy too. Here is the picture from ostentatious in miniature (the picture is so much better in full color ☺ ):
Gaunt: thin, pale, emaciated, almost skeletal/ghastly. 
Generic

Grammar: (See 125, 712, in text) syntax, sentence structure, parsing, morphology, linguistics: HISTORICAL ASIDE: At Focused, we encourage a simplified set of grammatical rules based on the single principle of agreement.  We have stripped away most of the artificial naming conventions in grammar, and instead take a functional, straightforward approach.  In our work, and because we all like to think about things and what other people in the world are doing and thinking about education and learning, we have taken something of a pedagogical interest in the study and teaching of grammar, math, vocabulary, reading, history, culture and civics throughout the course of United States history.  As a result, we stumbled on another mind from long ago that similarly believed that English grammar could be simplified down to 16 rules (we believe it can be simplified to between 14 and 20).  This man was Noah Webster, and his 16 rules of grammar, contained in the final third or so of his Blue Back Speller educated every generation of Americans from 1786 until at least 1840, and remained in use at least in pockets of the United States until about 1918, when a more complicated set of grammatical rules was put in place.  
Grandeur: splendor, magnificence, sumptuousness, opulence, greatness; grandeur is often awe inspiring, and is also often linked to something that is “divine”, magical, or which makes one feel smaller or more able to recognize the vastness and wonder of the larger world or universe.  I first experience the sense of the grandeur of the universe, and its awesome size when I opened an atlas across the front hall of my parent’s house when I was a child.  In the front of the atlas was a set of fold outs of the then known universe.  The fold outs showed me how small I and our whole little planet were and are in comparison to the size of the then known universe.  Below is a similar representation to what I saw when I was maybe 8 years old. Grandeur unlike awesome or awe inspiring does not inspire fear, more just respect. 
Grasp: (See 844, in text) understand, comprehend, follow, absorb, perceive; or, reach, pull, range scope. EXAMPLE: Some students believe they cannot grasp the concepts necessary to understand SAT math; grasping the concepts, however, is rarely the issue; rather, grappling with fear is more often the true obstacle to be overcome.

A humbling experience is one where a person’s defeat or complete lack of preparation for something makes him or her realize that he or she is not that awesome, powerful or important.  The person’s pride is damaged. His or her world view is changed. And, hopefully, he or she learns to work harder, take nothing for granted, value others more and, as a result becomes a better, humbler, but eventually more powerful person. I believe it is good to have humbling experiences; they seem to be what are most important in building the foundation of a great and important life.  Sometimes a person must “lose”, “be fired”,  “fall because of pride”—pride right before the fall is called hubris—is necessary for someone to value every moment he or she has and really learn his or her limits.

However, Musk has proven that he is capable of ridiculous technological feats, even those which others deem impossible, so he just might be able to erect his idea of the future of transportation, which would potentially be able to travel at 750mph and might be significantly (ten times) cheaper than high speed trains if his initial estimates are correct.

For example, the old “can of peanuts with spring loaded snake inside” gag is funny because one expects to eat some delicious peanuts, but is instead shocked by a serpentine projectile. Haha. Because this prank is so “old hat” (trite, unoriginal, overused), it has had to be updated. In its current state, the joke consists of purchasing an obviously fake can of peanuts with the spring-loaded snake inside. However, the snake should is removed, and the can, which looks exactly like one would expect a fake peanut can to look, is filled with peanuts.

Ingenuous: (1460) When compliments are ingenuous, a snarky (rude or critical) tone may belie the intended subtext, or the nasty and insulting implications that are hidden in a backhanded comment. For example, when a girl tells another that her handmade dress is “unique,” she must be careful not to sound too disgusted or surprised, or the other girl will undoubtedly know that she meant to say “hideous,” “dreadful,” or “no one else would ever wear that.”
Ingenuous: innocent, naive, simple, frank, candid
Inglorious: shameful, dishonorable, ignominious, humiliating, demeaning: the opposite of bringing glory, inglorious brings shame, dishonor, or infamy.  Infamy, or being infamous is someone who is “famous” for bad reasons.  Infamous or inglorious figures from the past include such reprobates as Bonnie and Clyde (a murderous and bank robbing couple from the beginning of the 20th century), Al Capone (a mobster from the 20th century), and Bernard Madoff (financier, who in 2010 was caught for money laundering and running a large fraudulent investment scheme, often referred to as a Ponzi Scheme.)  Ignominious is a wonderful synonym. 
Ingratiate: cultivate, flatter, schmooze, court, wheedle: EXAMPLE: Almost all students in high school would rather attempt to ingratiate themselves with their teachers than put in the hard work required to actually learn material: it is a shame that sycophants have replaced intellects as the new leaders of the educational world. 
Inheriting: receiving, getting, become heir to, be left, be willed: Inheritances can be financial, genetic, cultural, or psychological when the word is used literally or loosely metaphorically.  Often times, however, inheritance can be used to mean a heritage or cultural/artistic lineage from which a person or group draws its inspiration or tenets, even if said “inheritors” are not aware of their cultural or artistic “bloodlines”. EXAMPLE: Many modern artists  are completely unaware that what they consider their most “Avant-guard” stylistic reforms in the mediums of oil painting and marble sculpture were actually inherited from the pre-classical world of ancient Egypt and Babylon.  These techniques of flat representation, and multiple perspective representation were passed down throughout the generations and always remained in the background of all artistic representations.  As a result, what “cutting edge” artists call new and innovative is actually a dusty old inheritance passed down from one generation to the next for more than three millennia.

EXAMPLE: As we hope this set of exercises has shown, the creation of a dictionary or any lexicon, public, private or personal is at some level a matter of pure interpretation: the meanings of words changes over time, and begin to be interpreted differently.  For example, the word “radical” means at the root or base of something, at a fundamental level, or as part of an institutions or beings inherent constitution, yet from 1770 onward, “radical” change was suggested to the parliamentary system of England and the Colonies, as well as even more “radical” change to the rights and liberties of men and women in France, where absent any semblance of a Parliamentary, the “Divine Right of Kings” or the tyranny of men like Napoleon ruled the day.  As a result, the changes suggested struck at the core, base, root or foundation of government, thus making the changes “radical”.  Today, while the first definition of “radical” is still at the base or root in many dictionaries, the word itself has been more commonly interpreted to mean extreme, often vehement views intended to ferment extreme, non-majoritarian change or action in a system, government, organization, social group, society or culture.  Radical no longer means going back to core values, and the core rights of rational beings in a state of nature.  It has been interpreted to mean something far more “radical.”

Lascivious: lecherous, lewd, licentious, salacious, prurient: Here, the word is synonymous with deviant or excessive interest in all things lewd or licentious, and as such discussion is untoward (not appropriate or fitting for discussion) in a text such as this one, we will again defer to the most famously eponymous lexicographer and his unparalleled ability to craft clear, prudent—and resultantly often euphemistic—definitions.  From Webster’s 1828 Ed.:
Lassitude: weary, tired, listless, apathetic, lethargic. 
	Later on, in the 18th century, frigates began to be built as long as “ships of the line,” but even with 28 mounted guns, these frigates were still considered lightly armed, and they mostly served as escorts or patrol ships. However, in the late 19th century, as countries began building ironclad warships (ships that were built of metal and therefore relatively heavily armored compared to wooden warships of the past), armored frigates, which kept the name frigate because all of the guns were mounted on a single deck, became the most powerful and versatile warships on the seas for quite some time. In fact, armored frigates, rather than “ships of the line” became the model on which most modern warships were based, especially after advances in weaponry made longer range warfare at sea possible and ships no longer had to sail directly past each other in order to attack.

Lexicography: the writing, studying, and editing of dictionaries.  Noah Webster was the first great American Lexicographer, creating the largest most impressive dictionary in the world, his 1840 two volume 70,000 Webster’s dictionary masterpiece.  The 1840 dictionary was Webster’s third venture into lexicography.  His first was in 1806, when he published his Compendious Dictionary of the English Language. This first dictionary was likely Webster’s most libertine of lexicographical projects, although his 1828 dictionary is noted for its extremely clear and period appropriate definitions of words like “Constitution,” “Natural Liberty,” and “Civil Liberty”: Terms Webster defined as follows:

Look back at entry 29 “visionary” and its footnote. Clearly, the word “visionary” has become part of this education debate. This word and its two definitions are emblematic of what is at stake: Do you want to think of “visionaries” as the Encarta-Websters-Microsoft dictionary would like you to think of them, as irrational dreamers? Or would you prefer to think of a visionary the way Google’s dictionary would like you to think about them: as the leaders of the next generation of innovation, progress, and societal advance?

Materials Science: A field of science that involves studying materials at their atomic level in order to better understand or predict the macroscopic properties of materials (the strength, elasticity, and durability) that are used in building and technology. Since many of the barriers to better technology are the limits imposed by material properties, this science may be the key to making the next generation of truly groundbreaking advancements. For example, materials scientists are involved in the development of composite materials, which combine different materials in order to utilize or enhance the physical properties of both materials (steel-reinforced concrete or reinforced carbon-carbon, which is a thin laminate that coats spacecraft and protects from temperatures as high as 2700 °F upon reentry to the Earth’s atmosphere). Another example of a newly available material is grapheme, a one-atom thick sheet of graphite, which is composed of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice.

Furthermore, if you complete this entire companion (twice, or maybe every 6-12 weeks for a year) your vocabulary should be so thorough and varied that not only will standardized tests seem simple, but the world in general will also view you differently when you speak and write: “they” will see you as erudite, even pedagogical or professorial.

One option is to study very hard for your SATs, actually try enjoying this work—smile, laugh, remember this is an easy test compared to the ones in your life you will have to “take”—and earn enough points to go to college for free for four years. (Cost of Harvard, or any other private college is roughly $60,000 a year, prior to any “luxuries”, like dinner out, clothes, etc. or ≈ $250,000; and while this test won’t earn you an Ivy education for free—no academic scholarships—plenty of other fine institutions will pay you to attend, and mitigate the costs of your education if you show them high numbers on this test… Where else can you earn $250,000 in 6-24 weeks as a 16 year old?

Or, worse yet, if he is not mollified, he can be an angry lion when angry:  See:
Mollified: You’ve seen this several times now. If you know this word: loudly yell out your favorite synonym. If you somehow do not know this word yet: bang your head against your desk repeatedly, and use and icepack to mollify your headache.
Mollify: (522, 530, 563, 575, 597):  With such effusive repetition of the word “mollify” throughout this assignment, it would seem appropriate that you “mollify” your instructors, by assuring them that you know what the word means.

Mollifying: List 3 things that may mollify a wailing baby’s grief: (1), (2), (3).
more like family than a teacher: in context, this should be a huge clue for you.  Bells and whistles should go off in your head, and you should realize all at once that some word that means something familial (relating to the family), tender (kind), or endearing (warm feelings toward someone) is what you will want in a sentence.  In a sense, you want someone who you would think of as a favorite uncle or aunt.  Someone, avuncular.  We all love that word don’t we? I know I loved it since I was a little kid, and I first heard it and thought—Well, at least that won’t be tough to remember; it sounds like uncle. 
Morning vs. Mourning: This answer choice is a trick. Morning is a time of day, while mourning is an expression of deep sorrow or bereavement. The answer will lure in those who do not realize that “mourning” is a differently spelled homophone of “morning” and not an odd British spelling of the same word.

Mortify:  shame, humiliation, embarrassment, degradation, horrified: to experience something that makes one so ashamed, or embarrassed that he or she would rather die than continue experiencing the feeling.

NOTE
NOTE: As many of you who are now making your way through this first set of companions to the Focused Vocabulary Workbook may have noticed, the above has discussed Noah Webster, his dictionaries and speller, as well as his evolving political positions and how those evolving positions were reflected in his works, and the course of education in the United States.  This discussion is in part happenstance, as we here at Focused are all working together on a dictionary of sorts, discussion of lexicography and its history seem natural.  As the first and perhaps greatest of American lexicographers, Webster deserves discussion; however, Webster’s preeminence is not the primary reason for his prominence in this chapter of the Focused Vocabulary Workbook Companion. Currently, new reforms in education are taking place.  The nature and type of education of the next 3-4 generations of United States youth are at stake.  The way words are defined will be important.

	Now, finally, for your assignment: Take three (3) of the diction errors above and write funny “malapropisms” that misuse the words in context to make a risqué or comic error (faux pas).  Then destroy the joke you just made by explaining it.  Just to help you out, I will give you an example of how to do the assignment based on a funny student malapropism reported to me by my 10th Grade History Teacher, Mr. Bryer, at Holmdel High School in 1988.  Mr. Bryer reported that in a student’s report which, supposedly read as follows:

On the SAT reading section or any other time you are reading a scientific work, or if you are someday writing a scientific work, attempt to be careful when using the word “theory”.  A “theory” with a capital “T” is pretty much a fact.  So, few ideas or theoretical frame works, in the history of the world, can be properly called Theories, in the way that scientists mean the term. As a result, be very careful choosing any answer that uses the word theory, or even hypothesis for that matter.

On they proceeded; the lame man now warned of a brook;
	One morning, after he had finished his meditation, the old man opened his eyes and saw a scorpion floating helplessly in the water. As the scorpion was washed closer to the tree, the old man quickly stretched himself out on one of the long roots that branched out into the river and reached out to rescue the drowning creature.

Pedantic: Describe a teacher or fellow student who you believe is pedantic; give details about this individual’s pedantry:  .
Pedantic: overly focused on rules and details to the point of becoming foolish or absurd.  Picture the most annoying fellow student you have ever known, the one who argues every comma, period, and 37th definition of a word with a teacher, and not to get more points, but because this student is certain that he or she is correct and that the information is vital and interesting.  That annoying person is a pedant. He or she is acting pedantically. (I still think that person is still just trying to get points from somewhere, even if there are no points to gain, and no one to give them. Some habits are hard to break: See, Class Binder Lesson 8 and 10: Give Me More Points Teacher! for  the reference.)

Petroleum: fuel, gas, petrol, energy, juice: HISTORICAL, CULTURAL, and ECONOMIC ASIDE: The petroleum industry and its related products is the largest revenue business in the world. The largest 58 oil and gas companies in the world, absent their subsidiary products or petrochemicals created from oil and gas refining byproducts, generated more than 5.7 trillion dollars in revenue in 2013. Estimates place the total oil and gas industry revenues at more than $9.0 trillion for the same year.  This revenue represents approximately 12% of all revenue generated worldwide, as the total worldwide gross revenue for 2013 was estimated at approximately $75 trillion.  The petroleum and gas industry, however, and its subsidiaries, which include the entire petrochemical industry, refining, sales of petroleum and gas products, pipeline and infrastructure are estimated worldwide to include roughly $22 trillion or roughly 29% of the world economy annually.

Grant, which was robbing millions from both the rich and the poor, the noted thief only took from those who had a lot of money and subsequently spread his wealth to the poor in his community.
Pilfering: stealing, robbing, thieving, pickpocketing, defrauding. 
Piqued: (595) Are there any animals that pique your interest because of an interesting behavior? For example, lemmings, shown below, are small rodents that are commonly believed to commit mass suicide during migration. While there is some truth to this puzzling behavior, it is neither out of sheer stupidity nor out of morbid fatalism that these creatures throw themselves off of cliffs into bodies of water; lemmings, who are able to swim, will sometimes migrate in droves when their population density becomes too great, seeking new habitats across rivers or streams, which may sometimes be simply too broad for all of the lemmings to cross easily; invariably, some of the lemmings cannot make the journey and drown, which may be partly responsible for the sudden swings in the lemming population, which never seems to reach carrying capacity (the maximum possible number of animals of a species that can survive based on the availability of resources), swelling and returning to near extinction at irregular intervals.
Piqued: aroused someone’s interest, stimulate, whet, rouse, kindle, galvanize; felt irritated or resentful.

If you haven’t noticed yet, a lot of the words we have seen thus far actually sort of ‘loop’ around on the other related word.  Here, is something is polemical, it a type of argument or criticism that is marked by a tone that all that long list of other words you should know.  Sooner or later, you will begin to realize that if you know about 250-500 words, and all of their related synonyms, you will actually know all or most of the words not just on the SAT, but in the vast majority of the English Language.  Such a statement, if true, means that if you were to be taught this core set of words and their synonyms from earliest youth, none of you would have ANY PROBLEM AT ALL with vocabulary.  Reading would be far easier.  You would feel smarter. And, most importantly, the 10-12 years of school you have toiled through would be shortened to a handful or more efficiently, pointed useful years of actual education. Now all that’s left to do is lose a few million teachers, convince a few million people, and change the world.  If only it were that easy to—through one POLEMICAL ARGUMENT—change everything in the world….There might be some bias, oversimplification and hyperbole in the above POLEMIC, but it is difficult to be incisive, and sardonic, absent such exaggerated language and rhetoric. 
Policies (discuss employment policy labor disputes in this section)
Policy:  rule, strategy, stance, position, procedure, dogma, program:  shrewd or prudent course of action or pursuit of said course of action.

Polyglot: (940): Define “polyglot”:  .
Polyglot: multilingual, many languages, linguist. Someone who can speak many languages. (NOTE: Glottis is the tongue; languages are often called “tongues”, meaning a polyglot can speak in many “tongues”. 
Polymath: sage, fount of knowledge, renaissance man, genius, walking encyclopedia, “philosopher”. EXAMPLE: Benjamin Franklin and inventors like Elon Musk, Chandra Bose and Nikolai Tesla were all polymaths: individuals skilled in so many different disciplines that their breadth and depth of knowledge seems “unimaginable” to most. 
Polymer: (lure???): a compound composed of repeating small synthetic molecules.  This was a “sound lure” in this question; most of you should have realized that you needed a word which meant multiple or many: poly- as a prefix usually means many or multiple.  As we have said a number of times, knowing prefixes and suffixes, without knowing the meaning of the actual word tested can be as much a boon as a bust for your score.  
Ponderous: (21, 770) Ants can typically carry 10-50 times their own weight, which is impressive considering that 1000-7500 lbs would be far too ponderous a load for any human to bear. The weaver ant in the photo below is lifting a 500-mg weight, which is 100 times its own weight, using amazingly versatile sticky pads that change size depending on the weight of the object they are carrying. They can increase the size of the pads when they are attempting to lift something heavy, and they can decrease the size when they need to move quickly. Additionally, these ants make clever use of “peeling forces” to control how easily they can “unstick” themselves. The idea is similar to peeling tape off a surface; if you try to pull the tape along the surface, it will be very hard to remove the tape, but if you peel up the corner and pull the tape out from the wall, you can usually tear it right off. Similarly, when weaver ants want to stick to a surface, they will shift their legs to an angle that is closer to parallel to the surface, or running alongside the surface. When they want to detach easily, they make their legs more perpendicular to (at a 90° angle to, or going directly into) the surface so they can pull them directly off.

Feel free to continue your answer using additional paper if you believe your response significant.  If you do continue, please force your instructor to address your argument in class or privately.  Anything one feels strongly enough to actually work more than is required is deserved of a teacher’s attention. (JASON SAYS!)
Possessed: (503, 613, See 19, 35, 111, 133, 196, 232, 252, 693, in text): In all the Focused, November 2013 Essay Writing Companion, you all learned about how Ben Franklin and Galileo were possessed of the bravery and strength of character to challenge accepted ideas, and willingly sacrifice wealth, position and even their own lives for the larger good of all humanity.  These two men, two of history’s heroes, lived inspirational lives all based on the characters each possessed.  Is there any character trait that you aspire to possess or at least enhance over the course of your education so that you might either be more prepared for the way the world will change in the next 30 years, or which you believe will help your aspirations to actually change the world?  Use the next 10 lines to try your best to answer this question.  It is again an important one, one you should answer in your education, and which you must answer over the next 30 years of your life.  Take the time to think about it at least a little now.

Posthumous: after death, postmortem, subsequently, retrospectively. EXAMPLE: One would hope for more than simply posthumous recognition of his work, for in some cases, great efforts that shape the world are only realized for their genius after the genius himself has shed his mortal coil.  For example, Noah Webster, writer of a the first American English grammar primer—which educated the first five generations of Americans—and sole author of the first American dictionary, a work of 70,000 words, 22,000 illustrations and etymologies from the 26 languages Webster learned over the almost 30 years it took him to complete his lexicon, was never aware of the long standing success and more than two centuries of posthumous fame his dictionary would earn him: Noah Webster completed his definitive 1843 dictionary only a few days before his death, at the age of 82.  
Postmodernist: was a person who was part of a mid- to late twentieth- century artistic, philosophical, architectural and cultural movement which occurred primarily after World War I and as a reaction to the horrors of World War I. The movement intensified after World War II and took on more radical forms.  The primary idea behind the movement was that there was and should be a “value shift” after the lessons learned from the Wars. The shift in values occurred on a number of fronts: (1) the idea or conception of a narrative in fiction or theme in art changed dramatically.  No longer could people believe in culturally convenient narratives.  No longer could class be respected  The “absurd” or “unthinkable” had occurred during the Wars, and this unthinkable horror had to be reflected, if not tragically, then at least comically and absurdly in art.  Meaning, and what should have meaning---particularly in light of the past 2000 years of “cultural evolution” had to shift and take on, incorporate or acknowledge what this “evolutionary” process had done to itself twice in the span of 30 years.  
Potpourri: (See 410, in text) mixture, assortment, hodgepodge, assemblage, medley: EXAMPLE: This companion assignment offers a potpourri of lexicographical, historical, literary, social and other knowledge for any who choose to engage its cornucopia of words, definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and exercises.

Precociousness: mentally or intellectually advanced in a manner that is unusual for one’s age; or, blossoming or ripening early.  Generally, precocious children are called prodigies (kids who show enormous talent at an early age.)  (Note: prodigy, however, should not be confused with prodigious, which just means a large amount, or amazing/impressive; a prodigy may have a prodigious amount of talent for his or her age; however, all things prodigious are certainly not prodigies.)  
Predators: species that hunt other species for food.  People lacking moral character, who “prey” upon weaker, less fortunate members of society.

Products derived from the petroleum industry include plastics, most rubbers, computer chip related products, lubricants, detergents, polymers, isopropyl alcohol used for medicinal purposes, vinyl siding on homes, and a large percentage of the industrial polymers/lubricants which keep industrial culture lubricated and adhesive.  The overall effect of petroleum, gas and its byproducts represents the primary engine of the world economy and the primary fuel for every engine on the planet.  When coal is included into the financial consideration of fossil fuels the total contribution to the world economy of fossil fuels represents more than 1/3 of direct revenue worldwide annually, and when all derivative and subsidiary products are considered, the total impact of the industry and the effects on modernization, worldwide economic stability, employment, and standard of living for more than 4 billion people, one is left in sheer amazement at the impact of the industry, which finds its “fuel” from the remnants of single cell organisms which inhabited the planet more than 100 million years ago.

Progressive Party: Progressive College/Idea: You guys never know what progressive means.  When used in association with a college or institution, progressive means liberal, as in you go to college to learn things, to acquire the ability to write, read, analyze, do general things and learn about the world and what your place and the U.S.’s place in that world is.  You do not go to college to get a trade, per se.  I know to many of you and your parents this is insanity.  It is not really, it is progressive, it is liberalism, it launched companies like Google, Hewlett and Packard, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Space X, etc.  All of the Ivy League schools, Stanford and to a large degree even MIT and CalTech are “liberal education focused” or progressive colleges, which require a broader education.  Harvard in particular is a liberal arts college, with minimal if any engineering or other practical disciplines. Progressivism, insanity… liberal lunacy, or the place where 90% of the nation’s innovative product creating companies come from? You decide….Oh, wait… its already decided.

Recriminating: To respond to one accusation with another, counter accusation, directed most often at the accuser. Often recrimination relates to charging the original accuser with a like crime.  The word is not often used today, but there has been a surge in use of vocabulary related to the law on standardized tests over the last few years, and it seems a general belief in education—one with which I agree—that students should have at least a working knowledge of legal terminology.  I actually believe all Americas should have a first year legal education (referred to as a “1L” education or simply “1L”) as part of their public, high school education. It would so benefit everyone that if it could be done—if teachers could be found and the BAR associations and law schools would permit it—the whole of the nation would be better off.  EXAMPLE: I believe, however, that if I were to accuse the legal profession of cloistering away basic legal knowledge to maintain a medieval guild-like stranglehold on legal esotericism, or if I were to make statements which could be seen as allegations of a lack of competence in the current education system which might prohibit effective presentation of the 1L curriculum, I would likely face a litany of recriminations so encyclopedic that it would require, simply to catalogue, a lexicographer far more patient and pedagogically precise than even the prodigiously talented Mr. Noah Webster, L.L.M, attorney at law.

We should see an honest emulation among the married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the market.

EXAMPLE: The students so dreaded their reading assignments that there somber mood as they began their assignments would have lead an unknowing observer to believe that these young scholars appeared bereaved.  
Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed, and I have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an encumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine, and filth and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young laborers, they are now in as hopeful a condition; they cannot get work, and consequently pine away for want of nourishment, to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labor, they have not strength to perform it; and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come.

The Environmentalist: The formal scientific definition of theory is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.

We and I hope the above was understandable.  I—Jason—am making every effort to include as much history, philosophy, culture, and related erudition in this little companion piece.  The goal is to let you understand and appreciate the world in which you all live.  As a student wrote to me today: 
Undeserved: unwarranted, unmerited, unearned.
Unearthed: remove from the ground, uncovered, discovered, found but usually after a long period of time and with great effort.  Discover something hidden for a long time.  
Unencumbered: unfettered, unburdened, unweighted, and carrying no weight, light; or, creative, light of spirit.  
Unequivocal: You define it.  .
Unequivocating: unwavering, candid, direct, clearly and unambiguously stating a point.  
Uneventful: unexciting, uninteresting, monotonous, boring, insipid, unvaried, mundane
Unfathomable:  (See 5, in text) incomprehensible, enigmatic, indecipherable, obscure, inscrutable. EXAMPLE: It is equally as unfathomable that students today learn no grammar whatsoever in public schools, as it is incomprehensible that students from the last century were asked to learn 2350 pages of grammar rules alone. 
Unfortunate: (704, See 706, in text) List 3 antonyms: (1),
Unfortunate: having bad luck; unlucky, unsuccessful, untalented; euphemistically (if someone says “unfortunate” as a nice way of saying something else much worse) unfortunate means that a person’s “luck,” “personality,” or “success”—all of which are undesirable—were actually the person’s fault, or the result of an unchangeable personality fault in the individual.  EXAMPLE: The scientist was brilliant, but his unfortunate personality made him difficult to work with and destined most of his best and most innovative ideas to obscurity, as no one would work on projects with him.  
Unhinged: deranged, unbalanced, disturbed, crazy, bipolar, or just plain nuts. If someone becomes unhinged, he or she is not likely to look very “kempt” (unkempt:  disheveled, frazzled, frayed, rumpled, disarrayed).  
Unhinging: (830): 
Unique
Uniqueness (clothing, style)

Unmatched: unrivaled, supreme, matchless, without equals, unparalleled, consummate.
Unmitigated: (68): 
Unmitigated: unaltered, not lessened in anyway, offering something in its purest, often most offensive form. Common usage: unmitigated gall (unbelievable level of nerve, gumption, cajones…) 
Unofficially: unconfirmed, unauthenticated, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated, provisional
Unqualified: quack, untrained, inexperienced, unsuitable, unable, incompetent
Unrecognizable: (See 312, in text) distorted, unnatural, unidentifiable, unknowable, beyond recognition

Unrivaled: (465, See 459, 504, in text) 
Unrivaled: unmatched,  unparalleled, without peers or equals.
Unsanitary: unhygienic, dirty, contaminated, unhealthy, septic
Unscalable (sp???)
Unsolicited: unwanted, unrequested, undesired; ANTONYM solicited: requested, sold, advertised, lobbied for, petitioned for.  A salesman solicits business.  
Unsubstantiated
Untenable: indefensible, unsustainable, weak, unjustifiable, flimsy
Untried (racehorse in context—athlete, etc)
Use subject and object pronouns correctly, and watch out for inverted subjects and objects. (We simplified this rule to avoid using the terms nominative case and relative case.  The two cases simply mean a noun functioning like a subject, and a noun relating back to another noun. All you really have to do is figure out what the subject and verb of the sentences are and these rules unite into one simple rule).
Usurp: (See 832, in text) seize, assume, take over, commandeer, wrest, unseat. Seized or occupied and enjoyed by violence, or without right. (Thank you again, Mr. Webster.)
Utensils: tools, containers, implements, forks, knives, chopsticks, or items used in the kitchen, usually associated with food. 
Utility
Utilize: (See, 524, in text): use, exploit. 
Utter: (See 106, 1203, in text) complete, total, absolute, downright, sheer; or to speak: offer an utterance; 
Utterly
Vacuous
Vagaries: unpredictable unexpected change, action or idea; changing ones ideas and actions on a whim can lead to all sorts of vagaries in life. If one is lucky, those vagaries will all have a whimsical character, and hearty laughter will be had by all.  Similarly, following the rules of an eccentric (unconventional, often slightly strange, or aberrant: think: crazy cat lady—person, say like an ill-informed English teacher can lead one to experience all sorts of academic, literary, grammatical, ungrammatical and often “malapropian” vagaries caused by eccentricities.)
Variegated: a patchwork pattern in different colors; 
Variety
Vast: (See 393, 513, 750, in text) massive, huge, enormous, immense, prodigious
Vehemence: forcefulness, intensity, fervor, ardor, keenness; vehement is often used as an answer to SAT reading questions about tone. Along with ardent, zealous, and emphatic, vehement can describe the tone of passages in which the author or someone else strongly believes in what he is saying and makes his point by using language that shows emphasis, which can be accomplished by using hyperbolic or superlative (-est or –er words that show comparison) adjectives and adverbs (end in –ly) like greatest, most, extremely
Venerable: (1663): List three (3) synonyms and (2) antonyms for the word “venerable” :
Venerable: revered, honored, august, esteemed, admired: EXAMPLE: Almost all innovative scientific and cultural thinkers are called heretics by the more venerable members of the culture or community. 
Venerated: revered, adored, worshiped, hallowed, vaunted, esteemed
Veritable  
Veritable: actual, real, genuine, authentic, true. Veritable is used, generally, to emphasize a “figurative concept.” In this sentence, Martha Graham’s knowledge is a “veritable” treasure trove, as her knowledge is not actually a pot of leprechaun’s of gold at the end of rainbow, pirate’s gold, or some similar “trove” of actual treasure. It is metaphoric treasure, and so veritable works to emphasize the value of that “virtual”/metaphoric treasure. 
Versatile: multipurpose, adaptable, multifaceted, flexible, resourceful
Vessels: boat, ship, craft, watercraft
Viability: feasibility, practicality, capability, sustainability, attainability
Vicious: (See 644, 652, in text) spiteful, malicious, rancorous, remorseless, brutish
Vilified 
Vindicated
Vindicated: made right, corrected; cleared of blame, exonerated.
Vindicating: (548, See 131, 232, 356, in text) Do you remember the last time you were falsely accused of a transgression (wrongdoing, sin, offense)? Were you vindicated, or did you suffer the repercussions for a crime you didn’t commit? If you were excused, or cleared of guilt, draw your expression of relief when you found out you were free to go.
Vintage (clothing, style)
Violate: disrupt, interrupt, damage, infringe, deface: to break, transgress, or infringe. To injure; to hurt; to interrupt; to disturb; as, to violate sleep.  To break; to infringe; to transgress; EXAMPLES: as, to violate the laws of the state, or the rules of good breeding; to violate the divine commands; to violate ones vows or promises. Promises and commands may be violated negatively, by non-observance. Or, To injure; to do violence to. Or. To treat with irreverence; to profane.

Violent
Virtue: principle, ideal, feature, quality, character
Visceral: palpable, intuitive, instinctive, something felt in the “gut” at an animal or instinctual level: passionate, primal, animalistic feelings, impulses, drives and instincts. 
Visionary: (29, See 28, 35, 336, 361, 730, 737, 748, 779, 844, in text): List two (2) synonyms and three (3) antonyms for the word “visionary”: Synonyms: (1) , (2) . Antonyms: (1) , (2) , (3) . 
Visionary: inspired, imaginative, creative, inventive, ingenious, enterprising, innovative characterized by unusually acute (accurate and incisive, sharp, to the point) foresight (seeing the future well, or planning amazingly well, as the future unfolds just as the planning outlined and the visionary planner predicted.) A tertiary (third) definition of visionary is someone who has visions, or who is dreamy or impractical.  This is not the way the word is generally used when someone says something like: Steve Jobs was the visionary computer programmer who changed the world with incredible foresight regarding and understanding of both how consumer preferences would evolve, and how technology would and should best evolve along with those preferences. 
Visual art: forms of art such as paintings, photographs, and sculptures that are intended to be looked at; generally any art in which the image, colors, and arrangement are the primary or sole form of communication with an observer (basically not music or literature).
Vital:  energetic, vigorous, full of life, vivacious, in some contexts essential, or necessary.   
Vital: (32, See 113, 124, 135, 220, 655, in text):  List at least 2 synonyms and 2 antonyms for the word “vital”: 
Vitality
Vivid: (1051) Some people have dreams so vivid that they almost seem like they are really happening. Draw something that you saw clearly in a dream, and be sure to include specific details that you can remember.
Vocabulary: (See 27, 59, 88, 96, 144, 502, 513, 655, 708, 714, 787 in text) lexis, terminology, lexicon, vernacular, lingo: Do you just love vocabulary now? 
Voice/ Voicing: To make publically known a point of view in context.  
Voluminous: (See 1364, in text) capacious, roomy, ample, bulky, extensive
Vulnerable: (See 681, in text) susceptible, prone, weak or open to infection or damage;

Ward: area, zone, region, division, as in an area of a hospital which deals with only one particular type of patient; OR a person or thing that is being guarded; OR a person or group that is in charge of guarding something else, such as Dick Grayson (aka Robin), one of the guardians of Gotham City, who was aptly played by Burt Ward on the original Batman television series.
Warranted
Wary: (See 30, 322, in text) cautious, suspicious, circumspect, chary, heedful EXAMPLE: One should be wary of any reading assignments containing large amounts of vocabulary which he does not know, as comprehension is almost directly related to one’s vocabulary. 
Wasting: losing money, weight, time, energy, anything really, and for the loss to be for no real purpose, and sort of a tragedy.  Right now I am discussing the, well, tragedy associated with students being forced to learn information, even at the finest institutions in the nation and the world, which is pathologically incorrect, and which anyone with an iPhone could prove incorrect.  Here I am speaking directly about chemistry, and ionic and covalent bonds: I offer a $100 bounty for anyone who can explain the structural and physical difference between these two types of bonds, and if you use the words SHARING, GIVING, or TAKING in relation to electrons, then you owe me $1000, assuming you take the bet.  There is a long story behind this one which I will likely write in a book someday. For now, suffice it to say, electrons cannot be shared, given or taken as they are quasi-matter, move at or near the speed of light, behave occasionally in ways that defy our natural laws and are not passed like Christmas presents between positively charged atomic nuclei.  I really want a practical difference, as no rule seems to hold for either all the time.  Any help appreciated, but be careful if you are considering taking the bet.   
Waxed: name three things that can “Wax”:(1), (2), (3). Now, describe how and why these three things “Wax” and perhaps even wane: 
Waxing: 
Weakened by: (See 50, 271, 608, 741, 824, 900, 989, in text) debilitated, enfeebled, deteriorated, enervated, crippled
Well-being: good health, good fortune, a person’s physical, economic, and social health or security.
Wellbeing: happiness, comfort, healthiness, welfare, safety
Well-known (Check Question Carefully): (See 120, in text): common, culturally relevant, existing in the common body of knowledge, renown, famous, celebrated, eminent, recognized. 
Well-known: (956, See 120, in text): List five (5) synonyms for “well-known”: (1) , (2), (3), (4), (5).  
Well-regarded: esteemed, respected, valued, honored, admired, venerated, beloved
Wetlands: swamp, marsh, mire, bog, everglade, quagmire, fens, or bayou. 
Whims: (See 101, 659, in text, 97 as whimsy) impulses, urges, notions, fancies, inclinations
Whimsy: being slightly odd or playfully humorous, but usually in an endearing (lovable) way.  This whole set of definitions and Focused Coaching’s materials in general have a tone that is, quite often, whimsical. Whimsical appears in tone questions all the time.  Rarely is there a whimsical tone in a passage that you will read on a formal exam. However, reading whimsical works, at least to me, is really fun.  Think about when Jules appears in the instruction, or about when there is a baby ninja throwing shuriken’s at answer choices (see explanation to question 2 above); those pictures and that attitude embodies (perfectly exemplifies or is the living, breathing example of) whimsy. 

Wildness: (See 88, 476, in text) craziness, madness, rowdiness, undisciplined, uncontrolled
William Barclay (STAMP COLLECTOR)
Wistful (2): deep in sad thoughts, yearning, or longing for something lost from the past. It is nostalgia with lots of sadness added. This word is very useful when describing tone.  Remember it!!!
Wistful: 
Wistful: 
Wistfully (2):  
Wizened: wrinkled, shriveled, or dried-up: wise people look wise because they are old and WRINKLED.	 
Wonder:  miracle, phenomenon, marvel, sensational, amazing, awe inspiring. EXAMPLE: It would be a wonder if you used this entire workbook and companion to so increase your vocabulary and reading ability that you actually understood, appreciated, and enjoyed taking an SAT and earning an 800 on the entire critical reading section of the test. WONDEROUS! I say. Wondrous.
Worded (firmly in context) 
Work: (See 133, 221, 316, 335, 458, 571, 572, 581, 611, 612, 616, 751, in text) composition, piece, creation, opus, oeuvre: EXAMPLE: To those who believe and embrace the use of their minds, thought, productive labor and all things one usually would consider work seem like the most pleasurable of distractions in the world, save perhaps one’s own children.  Although, one’s own children and the creations brought about via his work are not so different in character or their genetic closeness to a man’s soul.  
World-weary: cynical, jaded, discontent, almost ≈ curmudgeonly:   tired of or bored with life or of the drudgery of some of the more petty, trivial, and unproductive human relationships that can exist—think about living in a reality TV show. 
Worn on… OR Wear on: verb referring to time elapsing, often indicating that the passage of time felt slow or took a long time.
Wrested control: (wrest): to take control or power against opposition and resistance.  To forcefully take something or pull something from someone. Seize. 
Zoning Committee: an elected or appointed government board that recommends boundaries for various zoning districts (commercial, or business, zones and residential, or living, zones) and decide the regulations that will govern erecting and operating buildings in those zones. The committee must try to plan communities carefully by taking into account the rate of traffic through certain areas of town and the convenience and safety of the residents, making sure to keep business interests from interfering with the wellbeing of those in the neighborhood.
￼ Not all entrepreneurs are visionaries, but some are: Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Nikola Tesla, Ben Franklin, Meryl Stearns, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, Sergei Brin, there are lots of others.  The good ones are visionaries, the rest are making a living and don’t like other people’s rules. 
￼ The majority of the diction errors listed were taken from the Focused Coaching Class Binder 6th Edition, Class 9A, Extra Grammar, pp. 319-321.
￼ Kids attempting to dodge learning vocabulary often ask if “learning roots” could offer them a shortcut around actually learning what words mean.  In this instance, both words come from the same Indo-European root, Pondus, meaning weight—thinks “pound.” Somewhere around 1500, however, the two words finally split, and  Ponderous kept only the heavy/clumsy/unwieldy/slow labored—dim/dull—speech meaning—as an adjective, while Ponder took on a far less pejorative (expressing criticism)—most would even say a positive (Ant. pejorative) meaning: prudent, careful, prior, deliberate consideration of an potential event or action.  NOTE ALL OF THE PICTURES ARE PONDEROUS AS ALL LOOK SLOW, DIM WITTED, and UNGAINLY.  Of note, only the ape looks like he is pondering something. 
￼ Here, the “By” in the beginning of the sentence necessitates the use of “had been” rather than was, because the ratification had been completed by the date. Also of note, the passing of the Bill of Rights was the only reason a number of other states ratified the Constitution.  Rhode Island’s final ratification occurred because of political, economic, and military “pressure” exerted by the other 12 states, and foreign powers.  
￼ In grammar, when something “conditional” but hasn’t or will never happen (subjunctive), you should use a plural verb, regardless of whether or not the noun/subject is plural.  This rule is a little weak in modern grammar; however, if the subject and verb were inverted, then only the plural verb can be used. EXAMPLE: Were I to have worked at the firm in the 1980s, I would have made an enormous amount of money.  NOT INVERTED: If I were to have worked at the firm in the 1980s, I would have made an enormous amount of money. 
￼ Of note, if any of you use the Microsoft synonym finder (right click on a word and hit synonym) the word visionary ’s synonyms are unrealistic, impracticable, and quixotic. These are not the appropriate synonyms.  The best first synonyms of visionary as offered by Google, rather than Microsoft are: thinking about or planning the future with imagination or wisdom: "a visionary leader" synonyms: inspired, imaginative, creative, inventive, ingenious, enterprising, innovative.  If visionary refers to a person, Google says that that person has “original ideas about what the future will or could be like.” I add this aside just to mark that different cultures have different interpretations, or apply a different tone to a word.  I know that it’s unfair to you guys, but it does give you all a heads up on how to pick a job, if offered one by Microsoft and Google. Staid curmudgeons, hanging onto the past or optimistic, creative people with remarkably acute foresight…`
