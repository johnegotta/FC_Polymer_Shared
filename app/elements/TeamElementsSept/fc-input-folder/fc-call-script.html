<details><summary> Definitions</summary>
<p><b>A Returning Client</b> is a STUDENT who is participating in an CURRENT COURSE or who has participated in a PAST COURSE or STUDY GROUP. A Returning Client will be quickly locatable in the call logs via the automated search in the next pages "Name" "Phone" and "Email" fields. <br>

A sibling of a RETURNING CLIENT IS NOT A RETURNING CLIENT.</p>
<p><b>Past Inquirer</b> is a caller who has previously left contact information logged into the Focused Database via this interface.  Past Inquirers, like RETURNING CLIENTS, will be quickly locatable in the call logs via the automated search in the next pages "Name" "Phone" and "Email" fields.</p>

<p><b>A New Caller</b> is a caller who has not previously contacted Focused via phone or otherwise had their contact information entered into the Focused Database via this interface. (In the future, online contacts will be included in the Focused Database. When such is the case, it will be helpul if clients are asked if they have ever given contact information to Focused via the Focused Web Presence.  Such callers will, again, be quickly locatable in the call logs via the automated search in the next pages "Name" "Phone" and "Email" fields.)</p>
