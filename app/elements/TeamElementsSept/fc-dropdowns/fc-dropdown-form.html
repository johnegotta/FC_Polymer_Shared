<!--This generalized dropdown can be used with sets of inputs-taken from an input generating form-(coming soon).  This lower level fom will generate an output card. The fc-formOutputCard will then serve  as a personal and/or organizatioanl  record of a transaction, added client, billing, future business etc. or added request AND/OR a shared item for the content tags of generalzied menues/selectors, etc. 

The model is a simple one, which is essential to Polymer. This pattern, however, is ENHANCED via SHARED ELEMENTS via use of NEON ANIMATION, which share the same content. 


SEE BELOW:
				STANDARD POLYMER DATA MODEL 

********************************************************
**	Data flows down from host <<HH<< and is      	  **							 
**  'notified up' to host via binding and notify true.**
**    	              [HOST-HOLDER]					  **				 
**						 	^^					  	  **			
**				-<-<-HH<<-<-||->->HH->->-			  **				
**				^						^			  **		
** 				|						|			  **	
**[Doer(D1) shares w/HH]	 		[D2 shares w/HH]  **
********************************************************

				Animation STANDARD Model
********************************************************
**	Hosts use 'placeholder element' to "grow shrink"  **							 
**  different views onto the screen. In typical		  **
**	usage, HH1 is expanded view of HH2. EG: a chip    **
**	card bio or view more tag expands to full bio. 	  ** 
**    	 [HOST-HOLDER 1]		[HOST-HOLDER 2]		  **				 
**				^						^			  **

	Expanded Polymer Example with Student Super Element

**************************************************************
**				FCID Student HOST-HOLDER Super El			**
**	__________________________| |__________________________ **		
** 	  |						  | |  	     	  	      |     **
**	course el			  contactinfo 		        test[]	**
**	__|_______________________| |________________ ____|_____**
** |  |	  |	  |	 |	|  |   |  | | |    |	|	 | 	| |  | |**
**name|parent1|grade|school|tel|Email|Pay|address|FCID|year|**
**	  |                                          |    |    |**
**	  |											 |	  |	   |**
** NOTE: course key-values are NOT deeper down in the |    |**
** database; representation is flat, with all data in |	   |**
** course el residing at the same level as contactinfo|    |**
** 										         	  |	   |**
**Test El will reside here and be in // with course 	   |**
** and contactinfo										   |**
**************************************************************
Under this model, the super element will have access to all data
from its children, however and whenever they may change. This is 
relevant or at least related to the view and our future work, as well
as to the ease with which we can make dynamic, highly reusable elements for the Test, Teacher, Course, HWK, etc 
Super Elements which are all required for the MegaSuperElements: Young Scholars, PSAT 8/9, PSAT 10, PSAT NMSQTP, SAT, ACT, and w/e else we do.  

With animation-really because of the selector on the content tag as 
used during shared-element animation-we can actually have general top level elements, that can be stamped or factory implimented to any specific needs, through a limited set of attribute choices, and all because we will be drawing from a that draw from a common repository of items held in content selectors on the elements we are building.

Here is what I believe is possible, prudent, and the point of polymer.  

We make animated views that share elements.  These elements are repositoried in common used "content sets" and then are shared between the views ad infinitem via the animation.  

The example below is without animation. I am taking John's Loggin Form, wrapping it in a host holder and the content tag of the general fc-dropdown-form.  I will then make a form model representing the first input set in the call center.  That input set will have some of its inputs wrapped in a host-child model, as the info will always be needed together.  First and Last name, e.g. School, Grade, School Town; Tel and email will go together. fcid will be with them all.    Under this model, wether I am pulling a view or building inputs or building the inputs to build the inputs, this single model will suffice for all of the builds.  

IF WE DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME.
WE WILL MOVE RAPIDLY THROUGH THIS.  

We just have to share, concentrate, and not replicate work.

Okay... the below model will speak for itself. */-->
