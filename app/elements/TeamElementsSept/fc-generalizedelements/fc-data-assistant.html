				<p>	To efficiently use the Focused Dashboard and Data Assistant, all you have to do is lean back, and follow the prompts.  The interface was designed to be intuitive and easy to use. In other words, this interface does almost all of the work for you.  </p>
				
				<p> Let's start by learning some helpful terms that we will use throughout this tutorial and in the Focused Dashboard Displays.</p>

				<summary> <b>Key Call Center Definitions</b></summary>
				
				<p><b>A Returning Client</b> is a STUDENT who is participating in an CURRENT COURSE or who has participated in a PAST COURSE or STUDY GROUP. A Returning Client will be quickly locatable in the call logs via the automated search in the next pages "Name" "Phone" and "Email" fields. <br>

				A sibling of a RETURNING CLIENT IS NOT A RETURNING CLIENT.</p>

				<p><b>Past Inquirer</b> is a caller who has previously left contact information logged into the Focused Database via this interface.  Past Inquirers, like RETURNING CLIENTS, will be quickly locatable in the call logs via the automated search in the next pages "Name" "Phone" and "Email" fields.</p>

				<p><b>A New Caller</b> is a caller who has not previously contacted Focused via phone or otherwise had their contact information entered into the Focused Database via this interface. (In the future, online contacts will be included in the Focused Database. When such is the case, it will be helpul if clients are asked if they have ever given contact information to Focused via the Focused Web Presence.  Such callers will, again, be quickly locatable in the call logs via the automated search in the next pages "Name" "Phone" and "Email" fields.)</p>

				<p><b>A Call Log Search</b> is a search of the client calls for the last month.  This search is the typical search conducted at the call center. A Call Log Search occurs automatically and instantly as soon as you enter the first letter of the First Name of a Caller. </p>

				<p><b> A Record Search</b> is more thorough than a Call Log Search, and takes slightly longer.  A Record Search will search the entire Focused Database for the records of a client.  This search will include Call Log Records, Billing, Payments and Test Scores.</p>

					<summary> <b>Key Focused Coaching Course Related Terms</b></summary>
					<p><b> A Coach</b> or <b> Focused Coach</b> is an instructor, tutor, teacher, mentors, guide, guru, and/or student at Focused Coaching (Focused, for short).  At Focused, Focused Coaches do far more than just present materials, teach methods, or tutor to close gaps in knowledge. Focused Coaches become deeply intertwined in the personal psychology of their clients and use Focused Techniques to raise a Focused Client's performance to a peak level on test, game or meet day. We are Coaches and Mentors not <i>just</i> teachers.</p>

					<p><b>The Class</b> or <b> The 2400 Course</b> is Focused's signature offering.  The course includes more than 60 hours of instruction, 2200 pages of materials, 5-7 practice 2400 SAT exams and countless hours of additional help, mentoring and coaching by Focused Coaches.  In the last 12 months, one in 27 Focused students (mentees) has earned a perfect score. One in 73 students has seen a score rise in excess of 650 points in a single "Class".  Focused students roundly repeat that if they all would just follow the <b>Focused Syllabus</b> from the beginning of <b>The Class</b>, a move from 1450 to 2250 is more than possible over the <i>course</i> of <b>The Course</b>.</p>

					<p><b> The Syllabus</b> is a daily (seven days a week) schedule which offers students an ordered, well planned, and carefully calculated, step-by-step plan to improve their SAT scores, grades in school, overall writing ability, reading speed, and math fluency over the course of 36 days.  <b> The Syllabus</b> took years to create, and is constantly evolving as Focused adds to, refines <b> The Materials</b> (see below). Following <b> The Syllabus</b> and doing "real work" is the most important ingredient in a Focused recipee for success.</p> 
					<details>

					</details>
					<p><b> Study Group</b> has evolved into a two fold Focused offering.  For many students it represents a follow-up Focused course that both supplements and "finishes off" whatever concepts, work and/or material that students managed to overlook during <b>The Course</b>. <b> Study Group</b>, however, was intended as a supplement to <b>The Course</b> for students who had already completed 70+% of the materials, saw score improvements of over 300 points, and or who had scores above 1950 <i>after</i> taking <b> The Course</b>.  Students are <u>not permitted</u> to take <b>Study Group</b> without taking <b> The Course</b> as concepts, terminology, methods, and content taught only in <b> The Course</b> are required as foundational knowledge to even begin to understand the first day of lectures in <b> Study Group</b>.</p>

					<p><b> Study Group</b> has its own set of materials, The Study Group Companions, (see Materials, below).  These Companions by many former students and current educators to be <i> The Best Reading and Writing Materials Found Anywhere</i>.</p>
					<p><b> The New Course</b> or <b> The 1600 Course</b> (after March 2016, simply: <b>"The Course"</b>) is a new offering by Focused which will prepare students for the new 1600 SAT, which will arrive in March of 2016.  The 1600 Course will necessarily be more intense than the 2400 Course, as the 1600 SAT will cover two more years of mathematics, more rigorous writing and grammar tasks, and a far longer and more challenging set of reading passages, all of which rely on professional level vocabulary.  To prepare for the 1600 SAT, Focused Founders have created advanced digital resources, including this dashboard, designed to supplement and adapt to any and every students individual needs. </p>

					<p><b> Young Scholars</b> is an omnibus term that is intended to cover reading, writing and mathematics for grades 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, and 10.  <b> Young Scholars </b> was originally proposed and run in 2010.  The initial offering was filled to capacity and saw results for its initial 40 participants that would make even the most elite of magnet or private schools blush in comparison.  Focused has always intended on re-instating <b> Young Scholars</b> but demand for other Focused programs, and the limited time of Focused Founders to create and evolve materials and a comprehensive curriculum for 9 separate grades proved challenging.  Over the last four years, however, Focused Founders have religiously worked on the <b>Young Scholars</b> materials and now believe that not only is the material set ready, but events in the world of academics have made <b> Young Scholars</b> a high if not a first priority. (See, <b>The Evolving Testing Landscape</b>.)</p>

								<div class="first-timer"><p>To attempt a call list search, simply type the first and last name of the person calling into the input areas.  Be sure to hit the "TAB KEY", located on the left edge of the keyboard, just above the "Caps Lock" key to shift between inputs.</p>  

								<p>Try an input search now by typing in the <b>Caller First Name</b>: "Jason" then hit the "TAB KEY".  Now type in the input field <b> Caller Last Name</b>: "Frazzano".  If you have typed the name "Jason Frazzano" correctly two things should have happened: (1) a call memo should have appeared beneath the input area; this call memo will be the record of the phone call as kept in Focused Records, and as sent to the client in a confirmation email;  (2) the chronological list of calls to the right of the inputs should now have changed and should now show only calls from "Jason Frazzano".  </p>
