A) Near the equator, in Indonesia B) In the Arctic region C) In the Antarctic region D) Near the equator, in Ecuador 47. Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question? A) Lines 1-3 (“About 750 . . . Ice Age”) B) Lines 26-28 (“Such a . . . the cooling”) C) Lines 49-54 (“The volume . . . the Holocene”) D) Lines 61-64 (“It’s not... climate impacts”) 48. As used in line 68, the phrase “Another possible candidate” implies that A) powerful volcanic eruptions occur frequently. B) the effects of volcanic eruptions can last for centuries. C) scientists know of other volcanoes that erupted during the Middle Ages. D) other volcanoes have calderas that are very large. 49. Which choice best supports the claim that Quilotoa was not responsible for the Little Ice Age? A) Lines 3-4 (“Identifying... tricky”) B) Lines 26-28 (“Sucha... cooling”) C) Lines 43-46 (“The researchers... atop the volcano”) D) Lines 71-75 (“But... closer match”) 50. According to the data in the figure, the greatest below-average temperature variation occurred around what year? A) 1200 CE B) 1375 CE C) 1675 CE D) 1750 CE 51. The passage and the figure are in agreement that the onset of the Little Ice Age began A) around 1150 CE. B) just before 1300 CE. C) just before 1500 CE. D) around 1650 CE. 52. What statement is best supported by the data presented in the figure? A) The greatest cooling during the Little Ice Age occurred hundreds of years after the temperature peaks of the Medieval Warm Period. B) The sharp decline in temperature supports the hypothesis of an equatorial volcanic eruption in the Middle Ages. C) Pyroclastic flows from volcanic eruptions continued for hundreds of years after the eruptions had ended. D) Radiocarbon analysis is the best tool scientists have to determine the temperature variations after volcanic eruptions."
