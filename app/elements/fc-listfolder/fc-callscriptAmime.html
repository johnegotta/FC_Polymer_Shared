      <p>Try an input search now by typing in the <b>Caller First Name</b>: "Jason" then hit the "TAB KEY".  Now type in the input field <b> Caller Last Name</b>: "Frazzano".  If you have typed the name "Jason Frazzano" correctly two things should have happened: (1) a call memo should have appeared beneath the input area; this call memo will be the record of the phone call as kept in Focused Records, and as sent to the client in a confirmation email;  (2) the chronological list of calls to the right of the inputs should now have changed and should now show only calls from "Jason Frazzano".  </p>
