Minimal Total State Cost by 11th Grade: $201,000 of which $149,000 was born by the average property owner in the selected district. Additionally, because these numbers exclude federal education contributions in district, which increase costs by a de minimus 25%, annual expenditures for each student in selected district should exceed $22,500 a year and could be as high as $38,000 annually. These numbers should leave no room for Focused. Yet, we are tasked with not only doing the job schools failed to do for 11 years (k-10), we are tasked with doing it in less than 6 months and a cost of less than 1/100th the public education cost. When ROI is included based on our averaage results, our net cost represents a negative infinite compared to the cost of public school. At the very least, we are a bargain.
